                   after it is received, because once a event is acknowledged,
                   the event center does not guarantee that the event will
                   still be available next time, and if the client runs down
                   while processing the message, the message may not be

    Args:

        topic_name: Topic name (unique identification of the topic)
        consumer_id: Consumer ID, which uniquely identifies a consumer

            1. consumer_id is recommended to be generated using the
               Consumer.generate_consumer_id() method;
            2. If consumer_id is not specified, the field is automatically
               populated internally using Consumer.generate_consumer_id().

        group_id: Consumer group ID, which uniquely identifies a consumer group

            1. If this field is not passed, the broadcast consumption mode is
               used by default (which can be paired with start_from_now to
               specify where to start consuming events from);
            2. If group_id is passed, group consumption mode is enabled.

        start_from_now: Does consumption begin with the earliest events

            1. If the group_id field is specified, this field is simply ignored
               (as this field is not valid in group consumption mode);
            2. Otherwise, start_from_now == True means that consumption starts
               from the earliest recorded event for that Topic.

    Keyword Args:
        default_batch_consume_limit: Default batch consume limit

            1. This parameter specifies the number of events that will be
               pulled at most once by calling the consume method by default;
            2. Since the client will experience a round-trip delay each time it
               pulls an event from the event center, if it can only pull one
               event at a time when the network latency is high, it will
               greatly limit the consumption rate (messages per second), so the
               upper limit of events per bulk pull can be appropriately
               increased in the case of high network latency;
            3. This parameter specifies the default value, which can be
               overridden by passing the 'batch_consume_limit' parameter to the
               consume method when it is called.

        auto_convert_to_dict: Whether to automatically treat the event as json
                              and convert it to dict
            1. CEC supports delivering bytes or dict when using Producer for
               message production;
            2. If the corresponding prodcuer chooses to deliver a dict, the
               consumer may set this parameter to 'True' to ensure that the
               message returned via Consumer.consume() is automatically json
               decoded to a dict.
            3. If the corresponding producer chooses to deliver bytes, the
               consumer must set this parameter to 'False', because the
               underlying event content is in bytes format and can not be
               automatically decoded to dict.

    Returns:
        Consumer: One Consumer instance

    Examples:
        >>> consumer = dispatch_consumer(
            ... "redis://localhost:6379?password=123456"
